abstract={Robust machine learning is an increasingly important topic that focuses on developing models resilient to various forms of imperfect data. Due to the pervasiveness of recommender systems in online technologies, researchers have carried out several robustness studies focusing on data sparsity and profile injection attacks. Instead, we propose a more holistic view of robustness for recommender systems that encompasses multiple dimensions - robustness with respect to sub-populations, transformations, distributional disparity, attack, and data sparsity. While there are several libraries that allow users to compare different recommender system models, there is no software library for comprehensive robustness evaluation of recommender system models under different scenarios. As our main contribution, we present a robustness evaluation toolkit, Robustness Gym for RecSys (RGRecSys), that allows us to quickly and uniformly evaluate the robustness of recommender system models.},

abstract={Recommender systems may be confounded by various types of confounding factors (also called confounders) that may lead to inaccurate recommendations and sacrificed recommendation performance. Current approaches to solving the problem usually design each specific model for each specific confounder. However, real-world systems may include a huge number of confounders and thus designing each specific model for each specific confounder is unrealistic. More importantly, except for those "explicit confounders" that researchers can manually identify and process such as item's position in the ranking list, there are also many "latent confounders" that are beyond the imagination of researchers. For example, users' rating on a song may depend on their current mood or the current weather, and users' preference on ice creams may depend on the air temperature. Such latent confounders may be unobservable in the recorded training data. To solve the problem, we propose a deconfounded causal collaborative filtering model. We first frame user behaviors with unobserved confounders into a causal graph, and then we design a front-door adjustment model carefully fused with machine learning to deconfound the influence of unobserved confounders. The proposed model is able to handle both global confounders and personalized confounders. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our method is able to deconfound unobserved confounders to achieve better recommendation performance.},

abstract={The distribution gap between training datasets and data encountered in production is well acknowledged. Training datasets are often constructed over a fixed period of time and by carefully curating the data to be labeled. Thus, training datasets may not contain all possible variations of data that could be encountered in real-world production environments. Tasked with building an entity resolution system - a model that identifies and consolidates data points that represent the same person - our first model exhibited a clear training-production performance gap. In this case study, we discuss our human-in-the-loop enabled, data-centric solution to closing the training-production performance divergence. We conclude with takeaways that apply to data-centric learning at large.},

In our setting, unlabeled examples are drawn from a distribution and labels are crowdsourced from workers who operate under classification noise, each with their own noise parameter. We develop an end-to-end crowdsourced PAC learning algorithm that takes unlabeled data points as input and outputs a trained classifier. Our three-step algorithm incorporates majority voting, pure-exploration bandits, and noisy-PAC learning. We prove several guarantees on the number of tasks labeled by workers for PAC learning in this setting and show that our algorithm improves upon the baseline by reducing the total number of tasks given to workers. We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm by exploring its application to additional realistic crowdsourcing settings.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing,}, author={Shelby Heinecke and Lev Reyzin}, year={2019}, month={Oct.}, pages={41-49},

Networks can be used to model the connections of a vast community of internet-of-things (IoT) devices, the internet, and distributed databases, among other important computing contexts for AI. Learning algorithms, which generate trained models, can be strategically designed to learn from a variety of data-rich networks, such as sensor networks, device networks, or even networks of humans working on crowdsourcing tasks. In real-world settings, noise generated from sources such as device inaccuracy or human error are unavoidable. Likewise, attacks in real-world networks, such as the injection of malware, are inevitable due to their ever-evolving sophistication. In this thesis, we study the intrusions of noise and malicious attacks on networks and learning from networks. We devise structural and algorithmic solutions for mitigating the effects of these unwanted intrusions. We first we consider viral propagation under the independent cascade model of infection spread on half-regular bipartite networks and characterize the most resilient structures. Then, we study learning and generalizing from a network of crowd workers, where crowd workers provide erroneous labels to unlabelled data at fixed, unknown error rates. In this setting, we develop a three-step probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm that incorporates majority voting, pure-exploration bandits, and noisy-PAC learning and demonstrate our algorithm?s improvement over baseline approaches. Finally, we study learning from a network of participants, each with their own distribution on the unlabelled data in the presence of noise. We develop collaborative PAC algorithms robust to classification noise and prove sample complexity bounds. We also study the communication complexity of collaborative PAC learning, with and without classification noise, and develop communication efficient algorithms in both settings.}, publisher={University of Illinois at Chicago}, author={Heinecke, Shelby Lynn}, year={2020}, month={Aug},

   abstract={Motivated by problems modeling the spread of infections in networks, in this paper we explore which bipartite graphs are most resilient to widespread infections under various parameter settings. Namely, we study bipartite networks with a requirement of a minimum degree d on one side under an independent infection, independent transmission model. We completely characterize the optimal graphs in the case d=1, which already produces non-trivial behavior, and we give extremal results for the more general cases. We show that in the case d=2, surprisingly, the optimally resilient set of graphs includes a graph that is not one of the two "extremes" found in the case d=1.
Then, we briefly examine the case where we force a connectivity requirement instead of a one-sided degree requirement and again, we find that the set of the most resilient graphs contains more than the two "extremes." We also show that determining the subgraph of an arbitrary bipartite graph most resilient to infection is NP-hard for any one-sided minimal degree d >=1.}

We develop communication efficient collaborative PAC learning algorithms using distributed boosting. We then consider the communication cost of collaborative learning in the presence of classification noise. As an intermediate step, we show how collaborative PAC learning algorithms can be adapted to handle classification noise.
